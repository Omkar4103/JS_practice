1. A Fn which whenever invoked with "new" keyword returns an object,
if we use "this" keyword inside that Fn, it returns an Object with all
of the properties and methods mentioned inside that Fn, such Function is called as 
a constructor Fn
2. When we have an opportunity to create many elements with
similiar properties; A constructor Fn can be used in such cases
3. Example: A music player has similiar properties for all songs 
(title, likes, singer, genre, etc) A constructor fn can be used with 'this'
keyword and instantiated with the 'new' keyword for every song
